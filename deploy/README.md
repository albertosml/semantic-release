# Initialize backend

In order to deploy our resources on Terraform, we must firstly initialize the backend
on Azure storage account. For that, we have to run locally the `backend.tf` file.

Steps to execute:

1. Checkout the `backend` folder.
2. Add the [Azure subscription ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/get-subscription-tenant-id#find-your-azure-subscription) in an environment variable called `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.
```sh
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="azure-subscription-id"
```
3. Init terraform: `terraform init`
4. Plan the execution plan: `terraform plan -out backend`
5. Check the plan
6. Apply the plan: `terraform apply backend`
7. Remove all the files generated by Terraform while creating the resources, so it is not
pushed to the repository.
